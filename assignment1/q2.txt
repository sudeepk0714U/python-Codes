Nested loops :
    Nested loops in python are use to perform operations on multi-dimenstional data
    such as printing a matrix or printing a star pattern etc
    I involves using one loop in another loop
    eg : 
        for i in range(0,5):
            for j in range(0,i):
                print("* ")
            print()
    output:
        this code prints right triangle as shown below 
                          * 
                          * * 
                          * * * 
                          * * * *
